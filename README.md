## A simple and lightweight dictionary

I built this app with the purpose of study React, and how to 
share data between components, without use any state management library.

So, if you are searching for best practices, or best way to share 
data in your application, consider search in another GitHub Repo.

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
